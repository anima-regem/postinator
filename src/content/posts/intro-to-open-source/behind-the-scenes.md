# Behind the Scenes: Intro to Open Source Workshop

## The Planning Phase

### Initial Brainstorming
The idea for this workshop was born from a simple observation: many students were interested in open source but didn't know where to start. We wanted to create a welcoming environment that would demystify the process and make it accessible to everyone.

### Content Development
- Created a structured curriculum that balanced theory and practice
- Designed hands-on exercises to reinforce key concepts
- Prepared real-world examples from popular open source projects
- Developed a step-by-step guide for making first contributions

## The Execution

### Pre-Workshop Setup
- Set up development environments for all participants
- Created sample repositories for practice
- Prepared presentation materials and documentation
- Conducted dry runs to ensure smooth delivery

### During the Workshop
- Started with an icebreaker activity to build community
- Used live coding demonstrations to show real-time contributions
- Provided one-on-one assistance during hands-on sessions
- Encouraged peer learning and collaboration

### Challenges Faced
- Some participants had varying levels of technical expertise
- Internet connectivity issues during the workshop
- Time management to cover all planned content
- Ensuring everyone could follow along with the exercises

## The Outcomes

### Success Stories
- 15 first-time contributors made their first pull requests
- 3 participants became regular contributors to open source projects
- Created a supportive community of new open source enthusiasts
- Received positive feedback about the workshop structure

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of clear documentation and step-by-step guides
- Value of having multiple mentors available for assistance
- Need for more practice exercises for different skill levels
- Benefits of creating a welcoming and inclusive environment

### Future Improvements
- Add more advanced topics for returning participants
- Create a follow-up workshop series
- Develop a mentorship program for ongoing support
- Build a resource library for self-paced learning
