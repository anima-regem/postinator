# Introduction to Open Source

## Main Story

The FOSS Club at GEC Palakkad hosted its inaugural workshop on March 15, 2025, focusing on introducing students to the world of open source. The event was attended by over 50 enthusiastic students from various departments, all eager to learn how to contribute to open source projects.

The workshop began with a comprehensive overview of what open source means and why it's important in today's tech landscape. Our lead instructor, Rahul Sharma, walked participants through the history of the open source movement and its impact on modern software development.

Participants were then guided through setting up their GitHub accounts and making their first pull requests to a specially created repository. The hands-on session allowed students to experience the entire workflow of contributing to an open source project, from forking a repository to submitting a pull request.

The workshop also covered important aspects of open source etiquette, including how to communicate effectively with project maintainers, how to find beginner-friendly issues, and how to document changes properly.

## Behind the Scenes

Planning this workshop was both challenging and rewarding! The idea came during one of our late-night brainstorming sessions where we realized many students were interested in contributing to open source but didn't know where to start.

Our team spent two weeks preparing the materials, creating sample repositories, and testing the workshop flow to ensure everything would run smoothly. We faced some last-minute challenges when we realized the college Wi-Fi might not support 50+ students simultaneously cloning repositories!

As a backup plan, we prepared USB drives with pre-cloned repositories and set up a local Git server. Fortunately, the IT department came through and boosted the Wi-Fi capacity for our event.

The most rewarding part was seeing the excitement on students' faces when their first pull requests were merged. One first-year student, Priya, was so thrilled that she immediately started looking for real projects to contribute to right after the workshop!

Our team of volunteers worked tirelessly behind the scenes, helping students troubleshoot Git issues and explaining concepts one-on-one. Special thanks to Arun, Divya, and Sanjay for staying until 8 PM to help the last few students complete their contributions.

This workshop has set the foundation for our future events, and we're already planning a follow-up session focused on contributing to specific open source projects in different programming languages.
